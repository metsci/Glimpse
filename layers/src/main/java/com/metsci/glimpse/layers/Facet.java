/**
 * A {@link Facet} is the representation of a {@link Layer} on a particular {@link View}. In
 * many cases, a facet will consist of a {@link GlimpsePainter} and some axis listeners.
 * <p>
 * A layer is responsible for creating its facets: one facet for each view on which the layer
 * wants to display itself. Typically the facet impl's constructor will take the view as an
 * argument, and call {@link View#requireTrait(String, Class)} (or a variation thereof -- see
 * next paragraph) to retrieve the traits that the facet needs.
 * <p>
 * Rather than calling {@link View#requireTrait(String, Class)} directly, it is usually better
 * to call a convenience function that has the appropriate trait key and class built in, such
 * as {@link GeoTrait#requireGeoTrait(View)}.
 * <p>
 * For example, a facet might call {@link TimeTrait#requireTimeTrait(View)}, add a listener
 * to the {@link TimeTrait#axis}, and in the axis listener do something along the lines of:
 * <pre>
 * {@code painter.setTime( selectedTime )}
 * </pre>
