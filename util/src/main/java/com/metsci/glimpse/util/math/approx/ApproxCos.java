/**
 * Similar to the classes in {@link com.metsci.glimpse.util.math.fast}, but uses linear interpolation
 * between samples instead of nearest-neighbor.
 * <p>
 * Anecdotally, speed is about 12x faster than {@link Math#cos(double)}. With 100k samples, max error
 * is around 5e-10. Max error decreases as the number of samples increases.
