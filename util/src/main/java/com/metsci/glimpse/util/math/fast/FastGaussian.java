/**
 * An approximation to a univariate gaussian pdf of mean zero, deviation 1.
 *
 * The width of the interval over which the function is sampled is chosen as
 * a function of the number of sample points to match the maximum error
 * within the table (which occurs at x = 1, where the slope is maximal) with
 * that at the boundary of the interval, outside of which the function is
 * assumed to be identically zero. It turns out that the exact value is
 * given by:
 *
 *     a = sqrt(W(exp(1)*n*n)),
 *
 * where W(z) is the Lambert function, [-a,a] is the interval over which
 * the function should be tabulated, and n is the number of sample points.
 *
 * For our purposes, the following asymptotic approximation to W(z) is
 * sufficient:
 *
 *     W(z) ~ ln(z) - ln(ln(z)) + ln(ln(z))/ln(z).
 *
 * Maximum magnitude of approximation error as a function of n:
 *
 *     n          error      interval where non-zero
 *   ------     ----------   -----------------------
 *      100     6.89x10^-3   [-2.85 , +2.85]
 *     1000     8.49x10^-4   [-3.51 , +3.51]
 *    10000     9.86x10^-5   [-4.08 , +4.08]
 *   100000     1.11x10^-5   [-4.58 , +4.58]
 *
 * Minimum value of n as a function of required accuracy:
 *
 *   accuracy        n
 *   --------    ---------
 *   < 10^-2         >= 66
 *   < 10^-3        >= 838
 *   < 10^-4       >= 9854
 *   < 10^-5     >= 111381
