/**
 * Uses non-public APIs (e.g. via reflection) to free the off-heap memory that
 * backs an NIO direct buffer. Normally such off-heap memory is not freed until
 * the garbage collector finalizes the direct buffer. This delay causes problems
 * when a lot of off-heap memory is used, but garbage collections are infrequent.
 * <p>
 * Currently only works for Oracle and OpenJDK, but could probably be extended to
 * others.
 * <p>
 * <strong><em>Use with caution.</em></strong> Deallocating a buffer inappropriately
 * can crash the JVM, or worse.
