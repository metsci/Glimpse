 * A loaded instance of a dspl Table. The getColumn() method should provide the primary key for the TableColumn.
 * A TableColumn always has a type, but does not have to have an associated Concept, so getConcept() may return null.<p>
 *
 * Usually only one of the typed data getter methods will return valid data (according to the type of the TableColumn
 * returned by getType). However, the TableColumn is allowed (but not required) to automatically coerce data (converting
 * Integers to Strings for example).
