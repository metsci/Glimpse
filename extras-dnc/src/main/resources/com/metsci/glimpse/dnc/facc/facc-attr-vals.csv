UK:   In the current values for BST, Definite equates to “de jure” which means that the boundary is recognised by the UN and internationally.  Indefinite equates to “de facto” which means that the boundary is agreed by the two states concerned, but has not been registered at the UN.  Recognised and not recognised implies a need to reflect that a national policy does not match UN recognition or local recognition.  This is understood and there are many examples.  But the problem is that there is no indication in the data as to “who recognises” or “who does not recognise”.  This is ok for a national only product, but not for data which may be used by other nations.  Summary: agree need, but need a way to represent the identity of the nation whose policy the terms represent.",,,,,,,,,,
