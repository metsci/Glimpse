CZ:  There was an evident typing error using % instead of ° (angular degrees). It is necessary to repair it.  Or to create new attributes with correct definitions.  Othervise a vertical bank - which is very often - will have the value of infinity (or undefined) % !!!   We can extend the range but not to infinity.
IT:  NO Agree with CZ comment,
US:  In DIGEST 2.0 the units are in percent, not degrees.  Why are these changes not OK when the same changes to BWL and BWR are?",,,,,,,,,,

INTERNATIONAL SCALE OF RIVER DIFFICULTY Revised 1998
American Whitewater:
1430 Fenwick Lane, Silver Spring, MD USA 20910 
Phone: (301) 589-9453
Class I: Easy. Fast moving water with riffles and small waves. Few obstructions, all obvious and easily missed with little training. Risk to swimmers is slight; self-rescue is easy.

Class II: Novice. Straightforward rapids with wide, clear channels which are evident without scouting. Occasional maneuvering may be required, but rocks and medium sized waves are easily missed by trained paddlers. Swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance, while helpful, is seldom needed. Rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated ""Class II+"".

Class III: Intermediate. Rapids with moderate, irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe. Complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in tight passages or around ledges are often required; large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided. Strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found, particularly on large-volume rivers. Scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties. Injuries while swimming are rare; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims. Rapids that are at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated ""Class III-"" or ""Class III+"" respectively.

Class IV: Advanced. Intense, powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water. Depending on the character of the river, it may feature large, unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure. A fast, reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers, scout rapids, or rest. Rapids may require ômust'' moves above dangerous hazards. Scouting may be necessary the first time down. Risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high, and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult. Group assistance for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills. A strong Eskimo roll is highly recommended. Rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated ""Class IV-"" or ""Class IV+"" respectively.

Class V: Expert. Extremely long, obstructed, or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to added risk. Drops may contain large, unavoidable waves and holes or steep, congested chutes with complex, demanding routes. Rapids may continue for long distances between pools, demanding a high level of fitness. What eddies exist may be small, turbulent, or difficult to reach. At the high end of the scale, several of these factors may be combined. Scouting is Recommended but may be difficult.
Swims are dangerous, and rescue is often difficult even for experts. A very reliable Eskimo roll, proper equipment, extensive experience, and practiced rescue skills are essential.
Because of the large range of difficulty that exists beyond class IV, Class 5 is an open ended, multiple level scale designated by Class 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc... Each of these levels is an order of magnitude more difficult than the last. Example: Increasing difficulty from class 5.0 to class 5.1 is a similar order of magnitude as increasing from class IV to Class 5.0.

Class VI: Extreme and Exploratory. These runs have almost never been attempted and often exemplify the extremes of difficulty, unpredictability and danger. The consequences of errors are very severe and rescue may be impossible. For teams of experts only, at favorable water levels, after close personal inspection and taking all precautions. After a Class VI rapids has been run many times, It's rating may be changed to an apppropriate Class 5.x rating.

The above was an update of an older US classification system adopted in 1959 given here:
CLASS I: EASY.
Fast moving water with riffles and small waves. Few obstructions, all obvious and easily missed with little training. Risk to swimmers is slight; self-rescue is easy. 
CLASS II: NOVICE.
Straight forward rapids with wide, clear channels which are evident without scouting. Occasional maneuvering may be required; but rocks and medium-sized waves are easily missed by trained paddlers. Swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance, while helpful, is seldom needed. 
CLASS III: INTERMEDIATE.
Rapids with moderate, irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe. Complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control are often required; large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided. Strong eddies and powerful currents can be found, particularly on large-volume rivers. Scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties. Injuries while swimming are rare; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims. 
CLASS IV: ADVANCED.
Intense, powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water. Depending on the character of the river, it may feature large, unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure. A fast, reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers, scout rapids, or rest. Rapids may require ""must"" moves above dangerous hazards. Scouting is necessary the first time down. Risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high, and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult. Group assistance for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills. A strong Eskimo roll for kayakers is highly recommended. 
CLASS V: EXPERT.
Extremely long , obstructed, or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to above average endangerment. Drops may contain large, unavoidable waves and holes or steep, congested chutes with complex, demanding routes. Rapids may continue for long distances between pools, demanding a high level of fitness. What eddies exist may be small, turbulent, or difficult to reach. At the high end of the scale, several of these factors may be combined. Scouting is mandatory but often difficult even for experts. A very reliable Eskimo roll, proper equipment, extensive experience, and practiced rescue skills are essential for survival. 
CLASS VI: EXTREME.
One grade more difficult than Class V. These runs often exemplify the extremes of difficulty, unpredictably, and danger. The consequences of errors are very severe and rescue may be impossible. For teams of experts only, at favorable water levels, after close personal inspection and taking all precautions. This class does not represent drops thought to be unrunable, but may include rapids which are only occasionally run.

UK:  YES …but…  Already in 2.0A database!!!!  Agree, but suggest the names are added to the class numbers, for clarification..

CZ:  I know Rex tried to find official definition but did not succeed.  Continue searching the official definition?  Or - if this one is not official - let's use another - simpler.
I found following ""international definitions"" at 
either a)  http://www.whitewatervoyages.com/
       Class I - Easy  Waves small, passagesclear; no serious obstacles.
      Class II - Medium  Rapids of moderate difficulty with passages clear.
     Class III - Difficult  Waves numerous, high, irregular; rocks; eddies; rapids with passages clear though narrow, requiring expertise in maneuvering. 
     Class IV - Very Difficult  Long rapids; waves powerful, irregular; dangerous rocks; boiling eddies; powerful and precise maneuvering required. 
      Class V - Extremely Difficult  Exceedingly difficult, long and violent rapids, following each other almost without interruption; riverbed extremely obstructed; big drops; violent currents; very steep gradient. Paddlers must pass the Class V Paddler's Test, and have prior Class IV or better whitewater experience.
     Class VI - Unrunnable  Just like it says - Don't even think about it!
      Portage - Boats must be carried along the river bank in order to circumvent an
unrunnable stretch of river. 

or b)  http://www.altosadv.com/l_raft.htm 
      RIVER DIFFICULTY RATINGS 
        I. EASY Waves small, no serious obstacles. 
       II. MEDIUM Rapids of moderate difficulty with clear passages.
      III. DIFFICULT Waves numerous high and irregular. Rocks and eddies with passages clear but often narrow. Manuevering often required.
     IV. VERY DIFFICULT Long and violent rapids with powerful waves. Powerful and precise manuevering can be required. Dangerous rocks and boiling eddies present.
      V. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT Exceedingly difficult long and violent rapids, often following each other without interruption. Big drops, violent currents. Riverbed can be extremely obstructed with steep gradient.
     VI. UNRUNNABLE Portaged (boats carried around rapid) on all commercial trips.

or c)  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/trails_and_waterways/state_canoe_routes/general.html
        CLASS I. Easy rapids with small waves and few obstructions. 
       CLASS II. Rapids with waves up to three feet high. Some
maneuvering is required. 
      CLASS III. Difficult rapids with high, irregular waves capable of
swamping an open canoe. Narrow chutes may require extensive
maneuvering. Usually considered the limit for an experienced paddler
in an open canoe. 
      CLASS IV. Long, turbulent rapids with high, irregular waves,
constricted passages and blind drops. Decked canoes and kayaks
only; open canoes should be portaged. 
      CLASS V. Long, violent rapids with complex routes and steep drops
or waterfalls. Hazard to life in the event of a mishap. Runnable only
by experts in decked boats. 
      CLASS VI. Cannot be attempted without great risk to life.
