/**
 * A helper class used to rate-limit events.
 * <p>
 * The DelayedEventDispatcher should be notified whenever events of interest occur via {@link #eventOccurred(Object)}.
 * Then, when no events have occurred for the duration of time specified in the constructor, {@link #eventDispatch(Object)} is called.
 * <p>
 * This class differs from {@link RateLimitedEventDispatcher} because if events are happening faster than the rate limit delay,
 * it will avoid sending any events until events have stopped arriving for at least the rate limit delay. Then it will forward the last event received.
 * Under the same circumstances, RateLimitedEventDispatcher will send a downsampled set of events spaced at exactly the rate limit delay.
