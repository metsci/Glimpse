package com.metsci.glimpse.axis;

/**
 * Defines how this axis will interact with its linked parent and child axis and
 * how it responds to having its size adjusted.
 *
 * MinMax update mode indicates that the minimum and maximum axis values do not
 * change when the axis is resized. When a linked axis is updated, this axis
 * adopts the minimum and maximum values of the linked axis. This is the default
 * behavior.
 *
 * MinScale update mode indicates that the minimum axis value and the axis scale
 * (in values per pixel) do not change when the axis is resized (the maximum
 * value is updated). When a linked axis is updated, this axis adopts the minimum
 * and scale values of the linked axis.
 *
 * CenterScale update mode indicates that the center axis value and axis scale
 * (in values per pixel) do not change when the axis is resized.
 *
 * FixedPixel update mode indicates that when the axis is resized, the absolute
 * min and max are updated so that the values/pixel ratio is constant. When a
 * linked axis is updated, the axis does nothing.
