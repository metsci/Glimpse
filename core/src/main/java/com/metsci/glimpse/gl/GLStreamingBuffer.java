/**
 * Represents a device buffer that needs to be re-written frequently, and
 * frequently read for rendering as well. Helpful for migrating away from
 * immediate-mode rendering.
 * <p>
 * Uses the recommended approach for
 * <a href="https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Buffer_Object_Streaming">buffer object streaming</a>.
 * Specifically:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Allocate a large block of device-buffer memory
 * <li>Write to a small section of the block
 * <li>Render using the written section
 * <li>Write to the <i>next</i> section of the block
 * <li>Render using the newly written section
 * <li>Repeat
 * <li>Once the whole block has been used, allocate a new block
 * </ol>
 * When a new block is allocated, the old block is dereferenced, but not
 * actually deleted until pending render operations are done with it. This
 * approach avoids driver-level synchronization, because the new block can
 * be written to without waiting for pending render operations to finish.
 * <p>
 * The cost is an increase in device-memory allocations. However, allocating
 * in large blocks keeps the frequency of allocations down. Furthermore, in
 * most cases, successive blocks will be the same size, so it is reasonable
 * to assume that old blocks will be recycled by the driver's memory manager.
 * For more info see the explanation <a href="https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/170118-VBOs-strangely-slow?p=1197780#post1197780">here</a>.
 * <p>
 * Expected usage looks something like this:
 * <pre>
 *    // At init-time
 *
 *    GLStreamingBuffer xyVbo = new GLStreamingBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_STREAM_DRAW, 100 );
 *    ...
 *
 *    // At render-time
 *
 *    int maxVertices = 10000;
 *    int floatsPerVertex = 2;
 *    FloatBuffer xyBuffer = xyVbo.mapFloats( gl, floatsPerVertex * maxVertices );
 *
 *    xyBuffer.put( x0 ).put( y0 );
 *    xyBuffer.put( x1 ).put( y1 );
 *    ...
 *
 *    int numVertices = xyBuffer.position( ) / floatsPerVertex;
 *    xyVbo.seal( gl );
 *
 *    gl.glBindBuffer( xyVbo.target, xyVbo.buffer( ) );
 *    gl.glVertexAttribPointer( ..., xyVbo.sealedOffset( ) );
 *    gl.glDrawArrays( ..., 0, numVertices );
 * </pre>
