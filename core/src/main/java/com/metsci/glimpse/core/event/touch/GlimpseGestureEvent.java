/**
 * Gesture implementations vary, but this event implementation should
 * be flexible enough for most platforms. Just like GlimpseMouseEvent,
 * this event class does not update a previous event. Gestures events
 * can be thought of as updates to a single gesture.  But we will
 * treat each event as self-contained (e.g. a lon pan is comprised of
 * multiple small pan events with small dx/dy).
 *
 * <p>
 * The source string can contain generic information about the source
 * of the touch.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is a reference point x,y for each event. For tap/long press
 * this is where the finger pressed the screen (in pixels).
 * For pan/swipe, this is where the finger was at the start of this
 * event. For pinch, this is the center X coordinate.
